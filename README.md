# Old Code

Since I started doing research (in the nineties) I have written a *huge* lot of code. Most of it was only useful to crunch some numbers and get the results I needed, and it's not worth anything. Occasionally, I had to program something interesting beyond its momentary usefulness.

In this repository I plan to upload some of the code that I think is worth saving. Not necessarily useful, not necessarily well coded. Just some of the code I enjoyed programming.
