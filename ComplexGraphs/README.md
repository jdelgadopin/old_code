# Agents on Complex Networks (2000-2001)

These are some graph building algorithms I implemented when my research topic was convention emergence on complex networks. At that time I was in a hurry, so the code is not clean nor nice. Also, my intention is just to save my code and get used to use git (which I should do more often). I do not think this is going to be useful to anyone.

`regular.c` Implementation of a regular graph, according to Kittock, J.E., *Emergent Conventions and the Structure of Multi-agent Systems*, in *1993 Lectures in Complex Systems* (L. Nadel \& D. Stein, eds.) (1995), SFI Studies in the sciences of complexity, Addison-Wesley.

`simple-scale-free.c` Implementation of a simple scale free graph, according to Barabasi, Albert & Jeong, *Phys. A 272*, 173 (1999)

`scale-free.c` Implementation of a scale free graph, according to Albert, Barabasi, *Phys. Rev. Lett. 85*, 5234 (2000)

`small-world.c` Implementation of a small world graph, according to Watts & Strogatz, *Nature 393*, 440 (1998)

`scale-free-fitness.c` Implementation of a scale free AND small world graph, according to Bianconi, Barabasi, *Europhys. Lett., 54* (4), 436 (2001)	

`measures.c` Implementation of the computation some measures on undirected graphs: clustering, correlations, diameter and average path length.
